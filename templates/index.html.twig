        Hardware Phoenix is a non-profit organization specialized in digital
        hardware reuse and reconstruction. It allows people to donate their hardware,
        which is then processed, tested and donated to the less privileged.
        To operate, the organization uses the Hardware Phoenix web platform.
        The specification, features and way of working of the platform
        is further described in this document.<br>

        In short, the platform allows the following features:
        <ul>
            <li>
                People can request to donate some piece of hardware to us
            </li>
            <li>
                Volunteers process the request (take care of delivery, storage etc)
            </li>
            <li>
                Volunteers process the hardware once it’s been delivered to us (categorization, tagging, decomposition into smaller parts etc)
            </li>
            <li>
                Volunteers donate the hardware (or some of the parts)
            </li>
        </ul>
